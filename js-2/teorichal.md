1.
Functions in  programming is the best solution that we can write some of code collection that in the block scope.So we can declare our code in local scope with function.so we can give it name ,call it, and execute it many times.
when we use let const in the function we make this function local.This unity is the best solving now in the programing.

2.when we use arguments in the function we make our algorithm dynamic.when we call arguments in console log we can pass every parameter, so it make our work much more easier , so also we can use rest ,spread operators that , it is also help us to pass collection of arguments in one call.
